# Python_Insta_Analytics

Initially this was intended to be a script that showed which accounts you follow on Instagram that do not follow you back, a functionality which forms the basis of many popular apps on the App Store. However, I found that the public Instagram API does not allow access to follower data, and thus the project instead ended up becoming a general analytics script for an Instagram account. 

The script currently prints information about the specified account, information about the accounts recent posts, calculates and prints the accounts average number of likes, and uses matplotlib to plot a graph of the accounts likes over time.

The set up included the following steps:
- Creating a Facebook Developer account and starting a new app.
- Switching my Instagram account to a business account to gain access to the Instagram Graph API. 
- Creating a Facebook page and linking my Instagram account to the page.
- Obtaining the necessary access tokens.
